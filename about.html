          <p>
            Our company has been in existence since 2019, in the period 2020-2021 our company opened the first mobile game. After a few weeks, 
            the game became very popular, 3 million people played it, there were a lot of orders for advertising, but our company did not stop there, 
            in the middle of 2022 we released 3 more games, two on the computer and one on the phone. Our company also plans to open tournaments. In 
            these years, our company also decided to cooperate with companies like epic games, twitter, fifa mobile. We plan to open a joint 
            project where we will get the rights (the game will belong to us) and others will receive a percentage of sales.
          </p>
